# Internship Project Core Study

## Week 1 Summary: Git Fundamentals

This project serves as the practical application for my graduation internship study on Distributed Version Control (Git). The first week focused entirely on core Git architecture and the local commit workflow.

### Core Learnings (Pro Git)

1.  **Snapshots, not Diffs:** Git saves the full state of the project with every commit, not just the changes between files.
2.  **Three States of Git:** The workflow involves three distinct areas:
    - **Working Directory:** Where files are actively modified.
    - **Staging Area (Index):** The intermediate area where selected changes are prepared for the next commit (`git add`).
    - **Git Repository:** The database where committed, permanent snapshots are stored (`git commit`).

### Practical Tasks Completed

- Git client successfully installed and verified.
- Global user identity configured (`user.name` and `user.email`).
- Local repository initialized (`git init`).
- First file (`README.md`) staged and committed to the repository.
