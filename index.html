### Action Plan: Complete Task 2 and Get Screenshot 8

Please try these steps again in order:

1.  **Open** your local `index.html` file in VS Code.
2.  **Copy all the text** from the box above and **paste it**, replacing all the existing content in your `index.html` file.
3.  **Save** the file.
4.  **Execute the following commands** in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Commit the change on the feature branch:
git add index.html
git commit -m "feat: Added project maintenance footer to index.html"

# 2. Switch to master, merge with --no-ff, and push (Creates Screenshot 8!)
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff feature/project-footer -m "Merge branch 'feature/project-footer'"
git push origin master
